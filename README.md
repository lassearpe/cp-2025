## Concurrent Programming 2025

### Useful notes

- At times, my VS code environment was completely broken. Doing  Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace from the Command Palette (Crl+Shift+P) solved this issue.
- "++" is not atomic on, say, integers. Assignment on the other hand, is.
- Starting a thread more than once will throw an exception.
